# FastAPI Dockerized Microservice PoC

## Description

This is a **proof of concept (PoC)** of a microservice developed with **FastAPI**, containerized with Docker, and deployed to the cloud. The goal is to demonstrate skills in:

- API development with FastAPI.
- Containerization with Docker.
- Cloud deployment using **Render**.
- CI/CD integration with **GitHub Actions** (optional).

The microservice exposes a simple endpoint that returns a test message.
